<P>PacMan is hungry but tired. He knows there is food around (he can
smell it), but how can he get to the food as efficiently as possible?
<BR>In this project, we have a simple PacMan environment in which
there are no ghosts and only a single food pellet. Your PacMan agent
will find paths through his maze world to reach a particular location
(where the food is). You will build general search algorithms and
apply them to PacMan scenarios.</P>

during the assignment. You should submit these two files (only). 
</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Welcome to PacMan 
</H3>
<P>After downloading the code (<A HREF="./search.zip">search.zip</A>),
unzipping it and changing to the <EM>search</EM> directory, you
should be able to play a game of PacMan by typing the following at
the command line: 
</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">python pacman.py</PRE><P>
PacMan lives in a shiny blue world of twisting corridors and tasty
round treats. Navigating this world efficiently will be PacMan's
first step in mastering his domain. 
</P>
<P>The simplest agent in <A HREF="./docs/searchAgents.html">searchAgents.py</A>
is called the <CODE>GoWestAgent</CODE>, which always goes West (a
trivial reflex agent). This agent can only be successful in very
simple and special worlds: 
</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">python pacman.py --layout testMaze --pacman GoWestAgent</PRE><P>
But, things already get ugly for this agent when turning is required:
</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">python pacman.py --layout tinyMaze --pacman GoWestAgent</PRE><P>
If pacman gets stuck, you can exit the game by typing CTRL-c into
your terminal. Soon, your agent will solve not only <CODE>tinyMaze</CODE>,
but any maze you want. Note that <CODE><A HREF="./docs/pacman.html">pacman.py</A></CODE>
supports a number of parameters (options) that can each be expressed
in a long way (e.g., <CODE>--layout</CODE>) or a short way (e.g.,
<CODE>-l</CODE>). You can see the list of all options and their
default values via: 
</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">python pacman.py -h</PRE><P>
Also, all of the commands that appear in this project also appear in
<A HREF="./commands.txt">commands.txt</A>,
for easy copying and pasting. 
</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Finding a Fixed Food Dot using Search Algorithms 
</H3>
<P>In <CODE><A HREF="./docs/searchAgents.html">searchAgents.py</A></CODE>,
you'll find a fully implemented <CODE>SearchAgent</CODE>, which plans
out a path through PacMan's world and then executes that path
step-by-step. The search algorithms for planning a path are not
implemented -- that's your job. As you work through the following
questions, you might need to refer to this <A HREF="#Glossary">glossary
of objects in the code</A>. First, test that the <CODE>SearchAgent</CODE>
is working correctly by running: 
</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">python pacman.py -l tinyMaze -p SearchAgent -a fn=tinyMazeSearch</PRE><P>
The command above tells the <CODE>SearchAgent</CODE> to use
<CODE>tinyMazeSearch</CODE> as its search algorithm, which is
implemented in <CODE><A HREF="./docs/search.html">search.py</A></CODE>.
PacMan should navigate the maze successfully. 
</P>
<P>Now it's time to write full-fledged generic search functions to
help PacMan plan routes! Pseudocode for the search algorithms you'll
write can be found in the lecture slides and Poole&amp;Mackworth.
Remember that a search node must contain not only a state but also
the information necessary to reconstruct the path (plan) which gets
to that state. 
</P>
<P><EM>Important note:</EM> All of your search functions need to
return a list of <EM>actions</EM> that will lead the agent from the
start to the goal. These actions all have to be legal moves (valid
directions, no moving through walls). 
</P>
<P><EM>Hint:</EM> Each algorithm is very similar. Algorithms for DFS,
BFS, UCS and A* differ only in the details of how the fringe is
managed. So, concentrate on getting DFS right and the rest should be
relatively straightforward. Indeed, one possible implementation
requires only a single generic search method which is configured with
an algorithm-specific queuing strategy (but your implementation need
<EM>not</EM> be of this form to receive full credit). 
</P>
<P><EM>Hint:</EM> Make sure to check out the <CODE>Stack, Queue</CODE>
and <CODE>PriorityQueue</CODE> types provided to you in <CODE><A HREF="./docs/util.html">util.py</A></CODE>!
</P>
<P><EM><STRONG>Assignment 1 </STRONG></EM>Implement the depth-first
search (DFS) algorithm in the <CODE>depthFirstSearch</CODE> function
in <CODE><A HREF="./docs/search.html">search.py</A></CODE>.
To make your algorithm <EM>complete</EM>, write the graph search
version of DFS, which avoids expanding any already visited states
(P&amp;M section 3.7.1). 
</P>
<P>Your code should quickly find a solution for: 
</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">python pacman.py -l tinyMaze -p SearchAgent
python pacman.py -l mediumMaze -p SearchAgent
python pacman.py -l bigMaze -z .5 -p SearchAgent</PRE><P>
The PacMan board will show an overlay of the states explored, and the
order in which they were explored (brighter red means earlier
exploration). Is the exploration order what you would have expected?
Does PacMan actually go to all the explored squares on his way to the
goal? 
</P>
<P><EM>Hint:</EM> If you use a <CODE>Stack</CODE> as your data
structure, the solution found by your DFS algorithm for <CODE>mediumMaze</CODE>
should have a length of 130 (provided you push successors onto the
fringe in the order provided by getSuccessors; you might get 244 if
you push them in the reverse order). Is this a least cost solution?
If not, think about what depth-first search is doing wrong. 
</P>
<P><EM><STRONG>Assignment 2 </STRONG></EM>Implement the breadth-first
search (BFS) algorithm in the <CODE>breadthFirstSearch</CODE>
function in <CODE><A HREF="./docs/search.html">search.py</A></CODE>.
Again, write a graph search algorithm that avoids expanding any
already visited states. Test your code the same way you did for
depth-first search. 
</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">python pacman.py -l mediumMaze -p SearchAgent -a fn=bfs
python pacman.py -l bigMaze -p SearchAgent -a fn=bfs -z .5</PRE><P>
Does BFS find a least cost solution? If not, check your
implementation. 
</P>
<P><EM>Hint:</EM> If PacMan moves too slowly for you, try the option
<CODE>--frameTime 0</CODE>. 
</P>
<P><EM>Note:</EM> If you've written your search code generically,
your code should work equally well for the eight-puzzle search
problem without any changes. 
</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">python eightpuzzle.py</PRE><H3 CLASS="western">
Varying the Cost Function 
</H3>
<P>While BFS will find a fewest-actions path to the goal, we might
want to find paths that are &quot;best&quot; in other senses.
Consider <CODE><A HREF="./layouts/mediumDottedMaze.lay">mediumDottedMaze</A></CODE>
and <CODE><A HREF="./layouts/mediumScaryMaze.lay">mediumScaryMaze</A></CODE>.
By changing the cost function, we can encourage PacMan to find
different paths. For example, we can charge more for dangerous steps
in ghost-ridden areas or less for steps in food-rich areas, and a
rational PacMan agent should adjust its behavior in response. 
</P>
<P><EM><STRONG>Assignment 3 </STRONG></EM>Implement the uniform-cost
graph search algorithm in the <CODE>uniformCostSearch</CODE> function
in <CODE><A HREF="./docs/search.html">search.py</A></CODE>.
We encourage you to look through <CODE><A HREF="./docs/util.html">util.py</A></CODE>
for some data structures that may be useful in your implementation.
You should now observe successful behavior in all three of the
following layouts, where the agents below are all UCS agents that
differ only in the cost function they use (the agents and cost
functions are written for you): 
</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">python pacman.py -l mediumMaze -p SearchAgent -a fn=ucs
python pacman.py -l mediumDottedMaze -p StayEastSearchAgent
python pacman.py -l mediumScaryMaze -p StayWestSearchAgent</PRE><P>
<EM>Note:</EM> You should get very low and very high path costs for
the <CODE>StayEastSearchAgent</CODE> and <CODE>StayWestSearchAgent</CODE>
respectively, due to their exponential cost functions (see
<CODE><A HREF="./docs/searchAgents.html">searchAgents.py</A></CODE>
for details). 
</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">A* search 
</H3>
<P><EM><STRONG>Assignment 4 </STRONG></EM>Implement A* graph search
in the empty function <CODE>aStarSearch</CODE> in <CODE><A HREF="./docs/search.html">search.py</A></CODE>.
A* takes a heuristic function as an argument. Heuristics take two
arguments: a state in the search problem (the main argument), and the
problem itself (for reference information). The <CODE>nullHeuristic</CODE>
heuristic function in <CODE><A HREF="./docs/search.html">search.py</A></CODE>
is a trivial example. 
</P>
<P>You can test your A* implementation on the original problem of
finding a path through a maze to a fixed position using the Manhattan
distance heuristic (implemented already as <CODE>manhattanHeuristic</CODE>
in <CODE><A HREF="./docs/searchAgents.html">searchAgents.py</A></CODE>).
</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">python pacman.py -l bigMaze -z .5 -p SearchAgent -a fn=astar,heuristic=manhattanHeuristic </PRE><P>
You should see that A* finds the optimal solution slightly faster
than uniform cost search (about 549 vs. 620 search nodes expanded in
our implementation, but ties in priority may make your numbers differ
slightly). What happens on <CODE>openMaze</CODE> for the various
search strategies? 
</P>
<P>The real power of A* will only be apparent with more challenging
search problems, in particular when more than one goal (i.e, food
pellet) has to be reached. That will be the topic for next week's
practical sessions. 
</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">BONUS: Changing the representation 
</H3>
<P>The PacMan world is full of corridors. Clearly it's stupid for
PacMan to go partway down a corridor and then turn around (when there
are no ghosts). However, the search methods used so far all check if
turning around is a reasonable option after every step down the
corridor (even if the cycle avoidance mechanism ensures that they do
not actually do turn around). Potentially, a lot of effort can be
saved by re-representing the problem in such a way that a single
action is moving the whole way down a corridor rather than just
moving one cell onwards. Replacing a sequence of actions by a single
action in this way is a form of problem abstraction, which is
commonly used to speed up search - in particular in computer games,
where the graph of cross-roads and moves between them is called the
<EM>waypoint graph</EM>. See e.g.
<A HREF="http://www.aiwisdom.com/ai_pathfinding.html">www.aiwisdom.com/ai_pathfinding.html
</A>
</P>
<P><EM><STRONG>Extra Credit Assignment </STRONG></EM>Implement the
missing code in the <CODE>CrossroadSearchAgent</CODE> in
<CODE><A HREF="./docs/searchAgents.html">searchAgents.py</A></CODE>,
so that one action is a move between crossroads in the map (i.e.
points where PacMan has more than 2 legal moves available).
