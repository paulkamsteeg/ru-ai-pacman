Introduction to AI – Part B (BKI122a): Course Handbook =====================================================

Introduction and Overview
-------------------------

Part A of Introduction to AI teaches the introductory theory of the
basic concepts in Artificial Intelligence, such as search,
representation, and machine learning, and applies that theory using
paper exercises to 'toy' problems. The aim of Introduction to AI Part B,
is to take that knowledge, implement in a computer and use it to solve
'real-world' problems. Implementing and experimenting with the methods
yourself gives you a more direct experience of their operation and makes
the ideas more concrete.

To make the course more fun
the 'real-world' problems we will be solving are all those faced by a
small yellow circle (![](images/pacman.png)) trying to find enough food to
survive in a world inhabited by deadly ghosts. Obviously, we can't go
around killing ![](images/pacman.png) all the time so we will use a
computer simulation of this environment, commonly called **PACMAN** 
(see [en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Man](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Man)).
**Pac-Man** ![](images/pacman.png) faces a number of challenges for which the AI
techniques taught in Intro2AI A can be used to solve, such as finding
the best path to the food, optimally avoiding the ghosts to stay alive
and identifying the type of ghost so it can better avoid it. The
assignments given during this course will lead you through how to help
![](images/pacman.png) survive as long as possible. The course
cumulates with a '[survival horror'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_horror%E2%80%8E)
competition where ![](images/pacman.png) must survive as long as possible, with the
team with longest living ![](images/pacman.png) declared the winner!

The teaching environment we are using is based on the one used
at UC Berkeley for their CS188 introductory AI
courses (see [ai.berkeley.edu/project_overview.html](http://ai.berkeley.edu/project_overview.html). We have modified this
environment slightly to fit better with our course, but it remains
largely similar to the orginal one. **Note:** an important aspect of this environment is that it
is based on the Python programming language (see [www.python.org](http://www.python.org/)). However, the amount of Python needed to complete the course is small, so we will teach you a **minimal subset** of Python needed in the first weeks.

NOTE: The Python code we are using **only** works with versions 3.X, **not** with 2.X. Thus if working on
your personal computer ensure you are using the correct version.

Course materials
----------------

All course materials (this handbook, the assignment manuals, the Python files in which to insert your code, etc.) 
can be found on a GitHub repository located 
at [github.com/MareinK/ru-ai-pacman-internal](https://github.com/MareinK/ru-ai-pacman-internal).
You do not need to have a GitHub account to access this repository.

NOTE: the manuals are best read from the GitHub itself, if you download them they will not be rendered optimally.

Structure
---------

The course runs for 9 actual weeks (11 calendar weeeks) with two 2hr practical sessions every week
on Mondays and Wednesdays in the "Scriptiewerkplaats (Thesis workshop)" TvA 6.-1.02. 
The first 5 weeks (7 weeks including holidays) consist of assignments where you will work in small groups (2
students) to implement and evaluate one of the basic AI methods to solve
a 'real-world' problem. Solutions to these assignments must be submitted
via Blackboard before the start of the following weeks first session. After the assignments have been graded, you will be given short
feedback on your submission. In addition an **example solution** to the
assignment will be made available after the assignment deadline.

The final 4 weeks are for a final project and competition where you take
all the knowledge you have learned to solve a more complex problem. The
groups' different solutions are compared in a competition.

In contrast to Intro2AI-A, all stages of this course are very hands-on
where you will work at a computer from a template system and problem
specification and are guided through the process of generating a
solution in a step-by-step manner. The final assignment stage is less
guided, but both the instructors and Teaching Assistants will be
available for to help with any questions you have during the scheduled
practical sessions, and **by appointment** at other times.

Grading
-------

You will get 10% of the grade (1 mark) for a serious participation: having handed in serious arttempts at all assignments. 
The (bi)weekly assignments are graded for quality to contribute another 60% (6 marks) to the final grade. 
The final project makes up the remaining 30% of the final grade.
For some weeks there are also ***Extra Credit*** assignments. Successfully completing **two (2)** (or more ;-)) of 
these extra-credit assignments gives an extra 10% (max.), up to where your final grade surpassses a 10.

The detailed mark breakdown for each of the assignments is given in the
detailed assignment description for each week, which will be uploaded to
Blackboard (Note: below we provide only a sketch of the assignment
topic). However, generally half (50%) of the assignment marks will be
given for a **working** solution, and
half (50%) for the clarity of the code and comments.
(Thus a badly written, but working code can obtain 50% of the available marks, or a clearly written
but non-working code will also obtain 50% of the available marks).

#### Resits

You can resit the final assignment, by individually re-submitting the
assignment, however the maximum score achievable for this resit is 70%
of the assignment points, i.e. 30\*.7=21%.

Due to the availability of example answers, a different procedure is
used to resit the (bi)weekly assignments. You can resit **one** of these assignents(the lowest grade)
by submityting a solution to a new assignment which will be made available **after** the final
competition. 
Note: this assignment will require approximately 1 ec of
effort, i.e. 28 hours, but due to the deadline for the
Binding Study Advice you will only have 1 week in which to do it!

Course Schedule
---------------

### Week 1,2: Python tutorial

NOTE: this topic actually takes 4 calender weeks, with two holiday weeks in between.

In these practical sessions we will go through some simple tutorials to
teach you the minimal subset of Python which you will need to complete
the later assignments. (Note: If you can already program in Python then
you may move on to the 1^st^ assignment.)

### Week 3: Single agent search (single goal) – get the food 

![](images/pacman.png) is hungry but tired, he
knows there is food here somewhere (he can smell it). How can he get to
the food as efficiently as possible?

Here we start with a simple Pacman environment where there are **no
ghosts** and only a single goal food
pellet. Your assignment is to implement and compare different search
methods so ![](images/pacman.png) can can find the
food pellet in the fewest moves possible.

Assignments:

Implement DFS, BFS, A\* (Also Lowest-cost-first aka Uniform-cost,
Best-first?) by filling in the empty parts of 'search.py' and using
pre-programmed data structures (state, fringe stack/queue, closed list
etc.)

Testing:

On predefined mazes of various sizes where goal always is (1,1) and
start = (n,n), i.e. opposite corner.

#### Extra Credit:

The PACMAN world is full of corridors. Clearly it is
stupid for
![](images/pacman.png) to go part way down a corridor and then turn
round (when there are no ghosts). However, the naïve search method used
above checks if turning around is a reasonable option after every step
down the corridor. Potentially, a lot of search effort could be saved by
representing the problem such that a
single action moves 
![](images/pacman.png) the whole way down a corridor rather than
every individual step. (Replacing a single move by a sequence in
this way is a form of problem abstraction, which is commonly used to
speed up search – particularly in computer games where the
graph of cross-roads and moves between them is
called the way-point graph – see e.g. [www.aiwisdom.com/ai\_pathfinding.html](http://www.aiwisdom.com/ai_pathfinding.html)

Assignment:

Modify the A\* method above to work such that actions move between
cross-roads in the map, i.e. points where ![](images/pacman.png) has more than 2
moves available.

Testing:

On predefined mazes of different size where goal always is (1,1) and
start = (n,n), compare the performance in terms of numbers of nodes
expanded by the simple and abstracted version of the problem.

### Week 4 : Single agent search (multiple goals) – get all the food 

![](images/pacman.png) Is **still** hhungry and tired, but this time there seems
to be lots of food! and not a ghost in sight! Your assignment is to modify the simple A\* method from the previous lecture to work when
![](images/pacman.png) wants to visit
lots of equally rewarding goals as efficiently as possible (i.e. in the
minimum number of moves).

Assignment:

\(1) Modify your A\* agent from last week to work when there are multiple
goals.

#### Extra Credit:

Some of the food-pellets are much
bigger than the others, how
would you modify your solution above to deal with this issue?

Assignment:

(1) Modify your multi-goal A\* agent to work when different goals have different
possible rewards.

### Week 5: Multi-agent (Adversarial) search – beat the Ghosts 

Oh No! Now there is a ghost
![](images/pacman.png) around who for some reason is trying to kill 
![](images/pacman.png)! 
![](images/pacman.png) needs some way of
planning to achieve his goals of eating the pellets, whilst avoiding the
ghosts. As we don't know how clever the 
![](images/ghost.png) are, for now we will assume they try to act optimally to
get 
![](images/pacman.png).

Assignments:

\(1) Implement a Minimax agent for 
![](images/pacman.png) so it can cope
with avoiding the 
![](images/ghost.png).

\(2) Implement alpha-beta pruning for your agent to improve its search
efficiency.

#### Extra Credit:

Now there are 2, 3, 4 ghosts. Extend
you solution so 
![](images/pacman.png) can cope where
when there are an arbitrary number of ghosts.

Assignments:

\(1) Adapt the MinimaxAgent to cope with more than 1
![](images/ghost.png).

\(2) Add alpha-beta pruning to your multi-adversary agent..


### Week 6-8 : Survival Competition Assignment 

![](images/pacman.png) now has
all the pieces needed to make a successful PACMAN agent.
In the final 2 weeks of the course you will put all the pieces together,
i.e. search and machine learning, to build an effective PACMAN playing
agent. In the final assignment competition the agents from different
groups will compete in a 'game-play' track to see which
teams agent can survive the longest in the PACMAN world.

Note: the competition world has 2 additional features not mentioned so
far:

1\) Multiple levels: if
![](images/pacman.png) survives one level (by eating all the pellets) he will move
on to the next level. Later levels will be **harder** due to having
either larger maps and/or more
![](images/ghosts.png) .

2 CPU limits : the time available for
![](images/pacman.png) to
compute the optimal move will be limited

Assignment:

(1) You have
3 weeks to build the best PACMAN agent you can. We will provide you
examples of the types of levels your agent will
encounter.

### Week 9 : Assignment Deadline & Competition 

The final assignment and competition will
take place on the last day of the course. On this day we plan to run the
competition on the beamer and you can invite your friends to see the
action. Each groups agent will be run through all the levels
of increasing difficulty until
![](images/pacman.png) dies.

![](images/pacman.png) 's total survival time and number of pellets
eaten in the last level completed are used
as the group score to decide on the winner.

As well as submitting your PACMAN agent, you must submit a short written
report (2-3 pages) explaining the methods used by your agent.
