If your group is not listed, be sure to: hand in the assignment on Blackboard; hand in just competitionAgents.py and not a zip file; not add any strange import statements. If you think something is wrong, get in contact.

Print statements slow your agent down. Be sure to remove/comment all print statements before submitting your agent.

Are not all group member names shown? Be sure to include a comment with all s-numbers in the code.

Notice your score fluctuating between versions of the leaderboard? This is because the average is not very strong: each level is only run 10 times. For the final leaderboard, each level will be run 50 times, so the average will be more precise.
