#### How to use the course material

There are several ways to use the material:

- Download [a zip file](https://github.com/MareinK/ru-ai-pacman/archive/master.zip) containing the current state of the material. This is the easiest method. Be aware though that the online material may change. Check out the [commits list](https://github.com/MareinK/ru-ai-pacman/commits/master) to see whether anything has changed. If there are any significant changes, these will of course also be announced on Blackboard.
- Use [git](https://git-scm.com/) to pull the repository to your computer, directly or after [forking](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/). This has the advantage of being able to easily pull in changes, but this method is not recommended unless you are familiar with git.

Feel free to suggest changes to the material through pull requests!

#### Viewing the assignment descriptions

We recommend viewing the assignment descriptions (the ```readme.md``` files in each folder) online on GitHub for the best experience. However, if you want to download the assignment descriptions and view them offline, you can do so by opening the file ```view-offline/index.html``` in a browser and selecting the ```readme.md``` file you want to view. Be aware that images are not visible when using this method.

#### The code

The code files for topics 1 and 2 are contained within the folders for those topics. Topics 3
through 5 use the Pacman framework which can be found in the `scripts` folder. Each of those topics
requires you to fill in code in some of the framework files. The files that you have to fill in are
found in the folders for the topics. To run the code for one of those topics, execute `run.py` in
the folder for that topic. Topic 6 has all of its code contained in its folder.
